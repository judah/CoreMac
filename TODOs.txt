something like withOwned, withRetained
  so that we can control when the release happens.
  BUT it'd be better if the user of a API func could determine this...
  E.g.: every type takes an STT param (MonadIO m => STT s m Data)
  and there's a function returnign STT stuff.
  For now, it's not a huge deal.

Lots more of the API

AllocatorRef should be a CFObject?

More efficient String marshalling

TODOs in Data module
